# Write-Board
HI!
This project was made by a very bored 17-year old that spends too much time on TikTok. I originally saw this project on TikTok (https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRjBbM6L/) and thought it was super satisfying and wanted to send custom messages to my friends that aren't as friendly as the original creator of the TikTok intended the board to be used. Send messages to your friends through a fun animation too!

## Usage
Creating a message is pretty simple: type a key on your keyboard and it gets inputted into the textbox and puts the cursor on the next textbox. Delete characters using backspace.
You can navigate through the textboxes when writing your message using arrow keys, enter, or tab.
You can press the play button and preview what the recipient of the message will see 
The message is exported through a link that gets copied to your clipboard after you press the send button. 

## Limitations
The textboxes only support ASCII characters. I used this because the message being sent is encoded into the URL and URLs only support ASCII characters. I could have turned the characters into their key codes but I found that the URLs were too long. I plan to get rid of this limitation in the future by using a database to store a simple key in the URL that will match up with a message in the database.
